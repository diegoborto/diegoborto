      <p>Hi there! I'm Diego, a chemist with a passion for coding and machine learning. 
        I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning to quantum chemistry and data analysis.
        To deepen this interest, I've been self-learning programming and data science.
        In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with code, exploring new tools, and building small personal projects.</p>
