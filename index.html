    <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Diego, a chemist with a passion for coding and machine learning. This passion for ML was sparked by the work I did during my bachelor's thesis, 
        which involved applying Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) Neural Networks to analyze concentration data for air pollutants.
        I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning to quantum chemistry and data analysis. To deepen this interest, I've been self-learning programming and data science, 
        exploring new tools, and building small personal projects. <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy doing sports, especially in the middle of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Topics that I'd like to explore in the future: Quantum Computing and Cryptography.
      </p>
